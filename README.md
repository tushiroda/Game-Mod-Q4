This is my mod for Quake 4, Quakefall, based on the game Titanfall 2 (you can tell my name is real original). I added a bunch of new functionality, different weapons, new upgrades, and a different gameplay loop.

## Installation:
Move the `Quakefall` folder into your Quake 4 mods folder. Run the game, click 'mods', and you should see Quakefall listed. Click the mod, and start a new game.

### Weapon changes
  - Hyperblaster -> Volt
  - Shotgun -> Mastiff
  - Machinegun -> R-97
  - Rocket Launcher -> SMR
  - Blaster -> Charge Rifle
  - Grenade Launcher -> Softball
  - Nailgun -> Wingman

### Movement additions
  - Can now sprint with shift
  - Can double jump
  - Can go into a slide by crouching with high momentum
  - Can do an air dash by pressing Q in the air
  - Can do slide / crouch jumps

### New Mechanics
  - There is now a Titan meter added to the hud
  - It slowly charges over time, and killing enemies adds extra charge
  - Once at max charge, press v to call in a Titan.
  - Titan shoots bigger guns and stuff, and can also crush enemies
  - No more fall damage
  - Weapons have infinite ammo but limited clips

### New Map
  - Now there's a new map when you spawn in
  - Enemies consistently spawn in waves
  - Some enemies you kill drop weapon upgrades

### New Menus and Hud
  - New main menu with a cooler picture and added descriptions
  - Already mentioned it, but a Titan meter has been added to the in game GUI
